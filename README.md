# MUSICAL TERRAIN
ALEX ESPOSITO

The idea behind this project is to create an application that can be used for both fun, and more importantly teaching. The main concept is to use a 3d terrain map to display soundwaves in a more physical way. As an additional layer there will be an added layer to the terrain making it actually look and feel more earth-like. Adding in mountainous landscape with trees rocks and other foiliage to represent other pieces of the musical composition in order to add that much more depth to the project. Depending on the wav of sound the program will be able to distinguish between frequencies and create different terrains accordingly.

This project will give me a chance to explore several add ons and different aspects of open frameworks, while also creating an empowering piece of software.
